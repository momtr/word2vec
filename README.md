# word2vec
A JavaScript implementation of word2vec (Google's SkipGram).
I know there are much faster libraries for other languages, however, it was a nice project to understand the concept of word2vec and skip grams.

The skip gram is a neural network. Parts of the code for the neural network can be found here: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS (by Coding Train).
